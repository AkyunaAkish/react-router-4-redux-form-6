// NESTED ROUTES: To use nested routes, simply add a route component within the
// JSX of one of your components make the beginning of the path the same as the
// route related to the parent component and then give the route a unique route
// path ending. The component will then be rendered within the parent component
// JSX where the route component is when that sub route is matched parent route
// is <Route path='/posts/new' component={PostsNew}/> then within the PostsNew
// component the following route is nested in the render JSX: <Route exact
// path='/posts/new/duh' component={Hello}/>
